\section{Introduction}
While writing the TDP, focus on your current research, clearly stating all scientific contribution, and why are they important for you and the league. The length of the TDP is limited to 6 pages. Please notice that changes to the margins, space between paragraphs, and font size are not allowed (such TDP will be rejected). We suggest to leave the hardware and software description for the end of the paper.

Remember that the TDP must contain the following information:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Description of the hardware and software including a list of integrated externally available components (including commercial products, freeware, Open Source, etc.)
	\item Innovative technology and scientific contribution
	\item Photo(s) of the robot
	\item Focus of research/research interests
	\item Re-usability of the system for other research groups
	\item Applicability of the robot in the real world
\end{itemize}
